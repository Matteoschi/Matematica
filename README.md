with this website you can calculate many different math and physics problems, the first thing you can do is for example calculate the answers of the equations and the vertices in x and y. you can calculate the maximum speed you can have in a curve with friction, calculate the motion of the projectile then final speed with respective flight time and finally you can calculate the impact of an object in the absence of friction.This website has been thought for a mibile use![Editing Tastiera-Pazza_README
